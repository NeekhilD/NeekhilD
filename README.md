👉🏻 As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing resolving any technical problems.

👉🏻 Alongside a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering currently, I am AWS Certified Solution Architect -Associate, soaking up as much knowledge and practice as I can in an attempt to perfect my craft. 

👉🏻 I have experience using Python/Django, Git/GitHub under my belt and I've just started diving into lambda functions and S3 storage on AWS and IaC Terraform by Hasicorp and in the near future planning to get my hands-on experience on Kubernetes 

👉🏻 Successes achieved during my time in this role include:

• Apprenticeship Virtual Experience Program by Aon 
• Accenture Nordic Developer Program 
• Deloitte Technology Consulting Virtual Internship

👉🏻 My strongest skill is my creativity.
